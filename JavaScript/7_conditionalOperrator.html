    每桶油漆可以刷 200 square feet,
    用亂數產生 150 ~1000 square feet 的整數亂數
    計算出需要幾桶油漆
    <script>
        window.onload = function () {
            let coverage = 200;  //每桶油漆可以刷 200 square feet, 
            let squareFeet = parseInt(Math.random() * 851) + 150;
            document.write(`squareFeet ---> ${squareFeet} <br>`);

            let cans = parseInt(squareFeet / coverage);
            cans += (squareFeet % coverage == 0) ? 0 : 1;
            document.write(`<h2>You need ${cans} cans of paint.`)

//             How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
// Leading you down into my core
// Where I've become so numb
// Without a soul
// My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
// Until you find it there and lead it back home
// Wake me up inside (save me)
// Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
// Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
// Before I come undone (save me)
// Save me from the nothing I've become
// Now that I know what I'm without
// You can't just leave me
// Breathe into me and make me real
// Bring (bring) me (me) to life
// Wake me up inside (save me)
// Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
// Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
// Before I come undone (save me)
// Save me from the nothing I've become
// Bring me to life
// I've been living a lie
// There's nothing inside
// Bring me to life
// Frozen (frozen) inside without your touch
// Without your love, darling
// Only (only) you are the life among the dead
// All of this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
// Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
// I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
// Got to open my eyes to everything
// Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
// Don't let me die here
// (There must be something more) bring me to life
// Wake me up inside (save me)
// Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
// Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
// Before I come undone (save me)
// Save me from the nothing I've become
// Bring me to life
// I've been living a lie
// There's nothing inside
// Bring me to life
