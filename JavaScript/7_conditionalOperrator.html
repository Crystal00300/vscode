    每桶油漆可以刷 200 square feet,
    用亂數產生 150 ~1000 square feet 的整數亂數
    計算出需要幾桶油漆
    <script>
        window.onload = function () {
            let coverage = 200;  //每桶油漆可以刷 200 square feet, 
            let squareFeet = parseInt(Math.random() * 851) + 150;
            document.write(`squareFeet ---> ${squareFeet} <br>`);

            let cans = parseInt(squareFeet / coverage);
            cans += (squareFeet % coverage == 0) ? 0 : 1;
            document.write(`<h2>You need ${cans} cans of paint.`)
